### Algorithm
We assume list is an array of n elements. We further assume that swap function swaps the values of the given array elements.
1. Check if the first element in the input array is greater than the next element in the array. 
2. If it is greater, swap the two elements; otherwise move the pointer forward in the array. 
3. Repeat Step 2 until we reach the end of the array. 
4. Check if the elements are sorted; if not, repeat the same process (Step 1 to Step 3) from the last element of the array to the first. 
5. The final output achieved is the sorted array.
